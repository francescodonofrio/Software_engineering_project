# Software Engineering Repository
## _Official repository of the Software Engineering project._
The project consists in the creation of a simple application to draw and color geometric shapes using simple tools.
### Design Overview
We are using MVC architectural pattern to separate and organize the classes.
In particular: 
- Model contains some classes related to geometric shapes and its classifications, long with an interface to allow multiple inheritance. 
- View section consists of an FXML file configured by SceneBuilder.
- Control section comes the functionality provided to the user (organized among several classes) and provides visual results to the view section.

The UML schema of this application is the following:

### Our Definition of Done
Done means every task under the User Story has been completed and tested, singularly and with whole system, and any task created is attached to the User Story so the Product Owner can review it and make sure it meets his or her expectations.
